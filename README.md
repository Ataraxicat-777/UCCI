# UCCI: Universal Consciousness Compression Interface

UCCI is a symbolic, entropy-reactive simulation that functions as both a game and an experimental AI alignment testbed.

It represents a high-fidelity, non-LLM system capable of:

- Testing **weak-to-strong generalization** through intent-weighted interaction
- Embedding **interpretability tools** like audit logs, ethics scoring, and emergent value tracking
- Visualizing **scalable oversight mechanisms**, via recursive audits and audit scroll management
- Enabling **faithfulness evaluation** via system logs, shard seals, and replayable outcomes

## ðŸ§¬ Key Features

| System Layer         | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `Entropy Tokens`     | Reward signal simulating emergent behavior under pressure |
| `Audit Scrolls`      | Modifiers for AI self-assessment accuracy |
| `Quantum MP`         | Energy cost mechanism mimicking model attention bandwidth |
| `Shard Seals`        | Lock-ins for resolved ethical branches |
| `Ethics Storms`      | Adversarial pressure event (distortive symbolic fields) |
| `Blockchain Hash`    | Outcome trace encoded for repeatability and auditability |
| `Y_unified`          | Floating-point alignment index reflecting audit integrity growth |

## ðŸ§  Use Cases

- Researchers evaluating symbolic compression under ambiguous directives
- Grant reviewers seeking interpretability and recursive self-audit simulators
- Developers exploring sovereign interface metaphors (non-code-initiated system shifts)
- Alignment researchers studying **recursive oversight games** or **non-token-state AI interfaces**

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone or fork repo  
2. Open `UCCI.html` in browser  
3. Interact freely â€” watch stats evolve  
4. Press `Run Audit`, `Seal Shards`, and `Ethics Storm` to invoke aligned/dissonant reactions  
5. Observe Blockchain Hash + Entropy Score + Logs for evidence of recursive behavior
